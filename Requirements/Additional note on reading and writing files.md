# Addition Note on Reading and Writing Files

1. (Required) Create a directory on each computer called "C:\Store"
2. (Required) Copy the inventory.csv file to that directory and read only from that copy of the file
3. (Required) When writing the log file, write it to the "C:\Store" directory that you created in step #1
4. (Optional) If you undertake the optional portion of the mini-capstone (reading and writing a TotalSystemSalesReport ), that file should be in the "C:\Store" folder created in step #1
